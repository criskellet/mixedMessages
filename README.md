Create a message generator that outputs a new random message every time it is run.  The message must consist of at least 3 different pieces of data.

## Project Objectives
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* develop locally on computer and run using node


## Technologies used
* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub
* command line (Git Bash)
* Markdown

## Sources
This was written as part of Codecademy online course to re-inforce information learnt in JavaScript videos.  This small project reinforced concepts learned regarding use of JavaScript iterators.  This is my first attempt at running JavaScrpit code locally on my machine, using Git Bash and Node.  Another first is the use of Markdown to create a README file for the project. Once the code was tested, the code along with the README are uploaded onto GitHub thereby enabling me to use source code control for this project.
